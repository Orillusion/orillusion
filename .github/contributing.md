# Orillusion Contributing Guide

Hi! I'm really excited that you are interested in contributing to Orillusion. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
- [Development Setup](#development-setup)
- [NPM Scripts](#scripts)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- Welcome to use [Github](https://github.com/Orillusion/orillusion/issues)  to report a issues, request a feature, or ask a question

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Don't directly send PR to `main` branch, unless it's a urgent bug fix/patch.

- Checkout a feature branch from a dev based branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.

- [Make sure to tick the "Allow edits from maintainers" box](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork). This allows us to directly make minor edits / refactors and saves a lot of time.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Add accompanying unit test or sample case.
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing a bug:

  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live sample/demo preferred.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.

- Make sure CI tests pass!

- Commit messages must follow the [commit message convention](./commit-convention.md) so that changelogs can be automatically generated.

## Development Setup

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **version 16+**, and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io) **version 7+** is perferred.

First, you need to clone/flok repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Orillusion/orillusion.git
$ cd orillusion
$ git checkout dev # `dev` branch is perfered to start your development
```

If you need to run samples, you may need to init the `assets` submodule to load models, images and other resources:

```bash
$ git submodule update --init # init /public assets folder, it may take a long time due to large file size
```

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ pnpm i # install dev deps of the project
```

A high level overview of main tools used:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for development bundling
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for production bundling
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for CI unit testing
- [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) for API docs generating

## Scripts

### Start a Dev server
After install all dependenceies of the project, just run `pnpm run dev` to boot up a dev environment locally, with live relaod of the soure code.

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```
After executing the above command, visit http://localhost:8000 and try live samples from `/samples`

### Build production libs
To build a production package:
```bash
$ pnpm run build
```
After executing the above command, the production libs (`orillusion.es.js` and `orillusion.umd.js`) will be generated in `dist` folder, along with all types `*.d.ts` in `dist/src` subfolder.

### Unit Test
To start an auto unit tests:
```bash
$ pnpm run test
```
This will start an electron window to run all tests in `test` folder. 

If you need to test in a docker/linux enviroment without GPU drivers:
```bash
$ pnpm run test:ci
```
This will force Electron to use a CPU based software Vulkan driver to process all tests with WebGPU APIs

### API docs
To generate API docs:
```bash
$ pnpm run docs # generate all docs, including core and packages
$ pnpm run docs:core # core docs only
```
All `md` docs will be generated in `docs` folder.
